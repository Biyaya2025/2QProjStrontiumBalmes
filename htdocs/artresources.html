          <p> The ibisPaint official Youtube channel has many short but informative videos on their channel. Their videos show you 
          how to fully utilize the features of their app, and teach you basic drawing concepts like how to draw eyes or shade 
          wrinkles. </p>

          <p> The <a href = "https://tips.clip-studio.com/en-us"> Clip Studio Tips website</a> offers a variety of tutorials on 
          their website related to different kinds of digital art, such as animation and comics. </p>
  
          <p> I particularly like their <a href="https://tips.clip-studio.com/en-us/articles/1196"> Professional Illustration Process
          </a> series of tutorials. Here, different artists take you through the process of finish a piece of theirs from start to 
          finish. You get to learn and see the different techniques that they use, and you might even pick up on some of them to 
          improve on your art as well.  </p>
